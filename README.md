This is a simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch application built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. It allows users to draw on a customizable grid using their mouse, mimicking the functionality of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.
The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling with JavaScript and CSS.
